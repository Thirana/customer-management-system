# Customer Management System

Full-stack customer management system for a software engineer interview assignment. The repository is structured as a monorepo with a Spring Boot backend, a planned React frontend, Docker-managed MariaDB, Flyway migrations, Swagger API documentation, and backend automated tests.

## Current Baseline

- Monorepo with backend Maven project under `backend/`
- Docker Compose MariaDB 10.6 for local development
- Flyway migration-only schema workflow
- Spring Boot 2.7.18 backend targeting Java 8
- Customer domain model with mobile numbers, addresses, cities, countries, and family members
- Customer CRUD API under `/api/v1/customers`
- City lookup API under `/api/v1/cities`
- Consistent `ApiResponse<T>` and `PageResponse<T>` response envelopes
- Request ID support through `X-Request-ID` response header and MDC logging
- Swagger UI through springdoc-openapi
- Dev customer seed script for Postman and manual GET endpoint testing
- Backend unit, MVC slice, repository, and context tests

The frontend is planned but has not been scaffolded yet.

```

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 compatible target support
- Maven
- Docker Desktop or another running Docker daemon
- Postman or another API client for manual testing

The backend currently runs locally on Java 21 as well, while Maven compiles the project with Java 8 target compatibility.

## Local Setup

1. Start MariaDB from the repository root.

```bash
docker compose up -d mariadb
```

2. Confirm the database container is healthy.

```bash
docker compose ps
```

3. Start the backend.

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The default active profile is `dev`. Flyway runs automatically on startup and applies the schema plus master data.

4. Open Swagger.

```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

## Database

Local MariaDB values are defined in `docker-compose.yml` and `backend/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`.

```text
Host: localhost
Port: 3306
Database: customer_management
Username: cms_user
Password: cms_password
```

Flyway owns schema changes. Hibernate is configured with `ddl-auto: validate` so the application fails fast if entity mappings drift from the migration scripts.

## Demo Data

Use the dev customer seed script when you want data for list/detail endpoint testing.

```bash
backend/scripts/seed-dev-customers.sh
```

What it does:

- deletes only customers whose NIC starts with `DEV-NIC-`
- inserts 8 deterministic dev customers
- adds mobile numbers and addresses
- adds a few customer family links
- prints the inserted customers

This script assumes the MariaDB container is running. It is safe to rerun.

## API Endpoints

Base URL:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Customer endpoints:

```text
GET    /api/v1/customers?page=0&size=10&sortBy=name&sortDir=asc
GET    /api/v1/customers/{id}
POST   /api/v1/customers
PUT    /api/v1/customers/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}
```

Master data endpoint:

```text
GET /api/v1/cities
```

Create customer request example:

```json
{
  "name": "Nimal Perera",
  "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
  "nicNumber": "NIC-POSTMAN-001",
  "mobileNumbers": ["0771234567"],
  "addresses": [
    {
      "addressLine1": "Line 1",
      "addressLine2": "Line 2",
      "cityId": 1
    }
  ],
  "familyMemberIds": []
}
```

All API responses use the same envelope shape:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Operation completed successfully.",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-25T10:00:00"
}
```

## Postman Testing Flow

1. Start MariaDB.
2. Run the dev seed script.
3. Start the backend.
4. Call `GET /api/v1/customers?page=0&size=20&sortBy=name&sortDir=asc`.
5. Copy a customer `id` from the list response.
6. Call `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}` to verify detail loading.
7. Create, update, and delete a customer with a non-`DEV-NIC-*` NIC so seeded data stays easy to reset.

## Backend Tests

Run backend tests from `backend/`.

```bash
mvn test
```

The current backend test suite covers:

- application context startup
- request ID filter behavior
- global exception handling
- repository queries and JPA mappings
- customer service business rules
- customer and master data controller response shapes

## Commands

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d mariadb
docker compose ps
docker compose down
backend/scripts/seed-dev-customers.sh
```

From `backend/`:

```bash
mvn test
mvn spring-boot:run
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

## Documentation Map

- `README.md` is the main monorepo setup and reviewer guide.
- `backend/README.md` contains backend-specific operational and implementation notes.

## Troubleshooting

- If MariaDB does not start, make sure Docker Desktop is running and retry `docker compose up -d mariadb`.
- If the backend cannot connect to MariaDB, confirm `docker compose ps` shows the `mariadb` service as healthy.
- If port `8080` is already in use, stop the existing process or change `server.port` temporarily.
- If Swagger does not load, confirm the backend started successfully and open `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
- If the seed script fails, confirm the MariaDB container is running and the database credentials match `docker-compose.yml`.
